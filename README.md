# CoinGecko-API-Docs-Project
**Documentation improvements for CoinGecko API**

Hi there, and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project is part of my personal portfolio, created to showcase the technical writing skills and hands-on API experience I'm actively developing in my current role.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been querying live databases and inspecting API responses firsthand â€” rather than relying on developers to provide the information for me. Since the real systems I work with are private and confidential, I recreated a similar experience using publicly available APIs.

For this project, I chose the `CoinGecko API`, a free and widely used cryptocurrency data API. My focus areas include:

- **Documenting selected endpoints** clearly and thoroughly
- **Demonstrating real-world querying practices**
- **Drafting an OpenAPI 3.0 specification** for a portion of the API
- **Providing ready-to-use example requests and responses**
- **Offering commentary on the APIâ€™s design and usability**


This latter bullet point is an area Iâ€™m passionate about from past experience participating in API design sessions and recent course I completed ([Design and Build Great Web APIs](https://www.educative.io/courses/design-and-build-great-web-api)" by Educative).

This project will continue evolving as I complete it. I'll also share reflections on my learning journey, challenges encountered and improvements made along the way.

Thanks for checking it out!
