**Documentation improvements for CoinGecko API**

> **Hi there, and welcome! 👋**  
> This project is part of my personal portfolio, created to showcase the technical writing skills and hands-on API experience I'm actively developing in my current role.

## ✨ About This Project

Recently, I’ve been working more closely with querying live databases and inspecting API responses firsthand, instead of relying on developers to fetch data for documentation.  
Since the real systems I work with are private and confidential, I recreated a similar experience using publicly available APIs.

For this project, I chose the [`CoinGecko API`](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation), a free and widely used cryptocurrency data API.

My focus areas include:

- 📝 Documenting selected endpoints clearly and thoroughly.
- 🔍 Demonstrating real-world querying practices.
- 📜 Drafting an OpenAPI 3.0 specification for key endpoints.
- 🧩 Providing ready-to-use example requests and responses.
- 💬 Offering insights into API design and usability.

> This latter bullet point is an area I’m passionate about from past experience participating in API design sessions and a recent course I completed ([Design and build great web APIs](https://www.educative.io/courses/design-and-build-great-web-api) by Educative).

This project will continue to evolve as I complete it. I'll also share reflections on my learning journey, challenges encountered, and improvements made along the way.
