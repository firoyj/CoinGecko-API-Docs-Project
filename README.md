# CoinGecko-API-Docs-Project
Documentation improvements for CoinGecko API

Hi there, and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project is part of my personal portfolio, designed to showcase some of the new technical skills Iâ€™m actively developing in my current role.

Iâ€™m excited to be working more closely with querying live databases and inspecting API responses firsthand â€” instead of relying on developers to fetch the information for me. Since the real systems I'm working with are private and confidential, I wanted to recreate the experience using publicly available APIs.

For this project, I chose the Â´CoinGecko APIÂ´, a free and widely used cryptocurrency data API. Iâ€™m focusing on:

- Documenting selected endpoints clearly and thoroughly.

- Demonstrating real-world querying practices.

- Drafting an OpenAPI 3.0 specification for part of the API.

- Providing example requests and responses developers can use immediately.

- Offering commentary on the APIâ€™s design and usability â€” an area Iâ€™m passionate about from past experience participating in API design sessions and training (e.g., "[Design and Build Great Web APIs](https://www.educative.io/courses/design-and-build-great-web-api)" by Educative).

This project is intended to evolve as I complete it. I'll be sharing reflections on my learning journey, challenges encountered and improvements made along the way.

Thanks for checking it out!
